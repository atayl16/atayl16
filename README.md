# Hi, I’m Alisha Taylor 👋  
*Full-Stack Software Engineer | Ruby on Rails & React | Remote-First*

I'm a full-stack developer who loves building meaningful, maintainable tools that help people get things done. I specialize in Ruby on Rails, React, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on developer experience, product thinking, and clean architecture.

🔧 **Tech I use regularly:**  
Ruby on Rails · React · RSpec · Supabase · PostgreSQL · Netlify · CI/CD · GitHub Actions

🎒 **Currently building:**  
- A private family messaging app (Rails + React)
- A RuneScape clan tracker (Supabase + Netlify)
- Islamic educational games for kids
- A full portfolio site featuring these projects

🧪 **Past wins:**  
- Built the “Data Wizard” tool at MyTime — still used daily to automate QA test setup  
- Redesigned donation tooling at Daily Kos for better maintainability and user experience  
- Launched and sold a Shopify store after reaching product-market fit

🪄 Still under the hood of it all, I believe in the magic of code.

My first tool was called **Data Wizard**, and the name stuck — because even after years of building, I still get that spark when something *just works*. My home office is a little slice of Middle-earth, filled with scrolls, runestones, and glowing screens. Code is my spellbook, and GitHub is the wand.

If you're building something meaningful (or magical), I'd love to hear about it.
